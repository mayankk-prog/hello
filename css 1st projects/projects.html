            <p>With the idea of imparting programming knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a
                dream, GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming excites you or you feel stifled, wondering how to prepare for
                interview questions or how to ace data structures and algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a one-stop solution.
                With every tick of time, we are adding arrows in our quiver. From articles on various computer science
                subjects to programming problems for practice, from basic to premium courses, from technologies to
                entrance examinations, we have been building ample content with superior quality. In a short span, we
                have built a community of 1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+ Contributors and 500+ Campus
                Ambassadors in various colleges across the nation. Our success stories include a lot of students who
                benefitted in their placements and landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic network
                of geeks and we are only a fraction of it yet.</p>
